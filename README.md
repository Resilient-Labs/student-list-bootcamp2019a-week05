## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS and JQuery

I built this project by first creating an HTML document in order to create the header, input form and the button elements. Then I created the JavaScript file that will target the elements in my HTML file and give them functions. After I completed both the HTML and JQuery I created a CSS file in order to style my site background image, font styles etc.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to use JQuery
