# Student List Project

This web application allows the user to create a list that appears after each list item is submitted into the form by saving the list items. In this case, the form is keeping track of attendance and is used to print the names of those who are present at the end of attendance-tracking.

## How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

## Optimizations

I would add a feature that would allow the user to see which names have been submitted as they go along to avoid potentially marking a classmate present twice for instance.

## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I learned how to push functions as well as gained more familiarity with appending lists.
